## 🧠 How the Application Works

Uses JavaScript DOM manipulation to dynamically create and update tasks

Stores task data in localStorage to ensure persistence

On page load, tasks are retrieved from localStorage and rendered automatically

Event listeners handle task actions (add, delete, complete)

CSS ensures clean layout and responsive UI
